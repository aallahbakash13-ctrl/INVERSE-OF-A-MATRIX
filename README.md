# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : Import the numpy library as np.
### Step 2: Define or read the matrix for which the inverse has to be calculated.
### Step 3: Use the function np.linalg.inv() to compute the inverse of the given matrix.
### Step 4: Print the inverse of the matrix.
